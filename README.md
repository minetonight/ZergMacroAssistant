# Meet Larry Crojerg

A periodic reminder to do your macro cycle and to spend your larva even more periodically. Not spending your larva is now punishable with stop of game sounds and music, as well as darkening the screen for 5 seconds.

Circular buffer of the last three keys that were pressed.
Every 15 seconds we check if we have used larva and raise warning in not.
Every 30 seconds we check if we have injected and raise warning in not.
